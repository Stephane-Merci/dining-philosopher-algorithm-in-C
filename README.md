## Key Features:

Thread-based philosophers: Simulates concurrent dining with multiple philosopher threads.
Semaphore synchronization: Ensures safe access to shared resources (forks) and avoids deadlocks.
State transitions: Tracks philosopher states (thinking, hungry, eating) for clear execution flow.

## Getting Started:

Clone the repository.
Compile the code with gcc dining_philosophers.c -lpthread.
Run the program to see philosophers think, eat, and put down forks!

## Learn More:

Explore the code to understand semaphore usage and philosopher behavior.
Experiment with different philosopher counts to observe potential deadlocks.
This project provides a hands-on example of concurrency and resource management concepts.
